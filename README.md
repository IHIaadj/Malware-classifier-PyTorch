# Malware Classifier with PyTorch
Malware Classifier is a Rest API made with Django that classifies apk files between legitimate and malware.

After finishing the Udacity course : **Deep learning with PyTorch**. We were told to make a side project to practice what we've learnt =) 


## Motivation and how I worked 
![Function](https://zupimages.net/up/19/01/vdf2.gif)
At first my motivation was to test myself on the acquired knowledge on the course and apply it on real examples and figure out if I can help and improve some ideas to produce a full well developed and helpful application. 
One of the side projects I made was this malware classifier. I always wondered how antivirus were made, I'm always surprised on the quantity of characteristics that we have to check to detect if a program is malicious or not, and I thought I can use deep learning to classify a program as legitimate or malicious.
After searching a bit I found some articles talking about classifying .apk files between malware and legitimate and without further reading my brain begins to think about several features that I can use to detect if It's a malware or not depending on the manifest file (I used to develop android applications so it was a fun experience to try to detect if an application respects the permissions). 

I found a cool XML parser **AXMLPrinter2** : https://github.com/flyfei/ApkDecompile/tree/master/Tools that extract the manifest from an apk and make it readable and I extracted all the permission that the app requires and those are my features (In the future the application may also extract the features requires from the manifest). 

Once I get how to extract the features from an apk, I searched for a dataset and found this one : https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/android-adware.html

Data ready .. Jump to the fun part ! The training one I chose to work on a fully connected Neural Network with (1 - 2 - 3 hidden layers) and played with the hyperparameters and the optimizer to obtain a Training accuracy of 98.3% and a Test accuracy of 95% on 1500 .apk in total.

I started deploying it on a web app and got it work and the next step is to deploy it as an Android App. 

## Requirements 
You'll find on the requirements.txt all the packages needed to run the application. 

## Test the application 
Clone the application and run the following commands : 

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

``` python manage.py runserver ```
